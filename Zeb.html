        <h1>Zeb</h1>

        <p>
        Zebra Zeb, more well known as Zeb, was a politician. He was the one of
        last Zebras in positions of power, and tried to lessen the sway of
        Pandas and Hippos. He was known for corruption and opportunism, which,
        along with "being salty for losing the fight", gave grounds for
        
        <a href="./Pan">Panda Pan</a> to
        <a href="War_of_Zeb_and_Pan">revolt against him</a>,
        where he would be killed by Pan's forces at
        <a href="The_Battle_of_Toothpicks">The Battle of Toothpicks</a>.
        
        His rule saw his kingdom's
        wealth fall quickly, due to bad laws.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
        Zeb was born on Febuary 34th, 65 BZD. He went to school at the rich kid
        school, and was infamous there for breaking a hole in a wall to get
        candy. Many people say that this was stirred by alike doings of the
        then-teenager Panda Pan. Pan then broke into the rich kid school and
        tried to talk to Zeb, but Zeb kicked him in the face while saying "You
        should bow down to me, peasant!". This would scar Pan for the rest of his
        life. Later, when Zeb was 8, he would take control of the school and
        started a mini country called Zebia. The school was under siege by
        police for 7 months because of this.

        When he was 17, he became a Pro Wrestler&trade;, and within 15.5 months he
        was so good, that his teacher said "He is the best in the world".

        <h2>Politcs</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
        In 42 BZD Zeb bribed the King to make him the Duke of The Savannah.
        There he put forth high taxes, cracked down on freedom of speech, got
        rid of the duchy's old guard, and centralized the governement. This
        significantly increased revenue for both him and more importantly the
        King, which insured his support. A snag remained in that most of the
        lesser nobles in the Savannah were fighting amongst each other, severly
        hurting the economy. Zeb found an excuse to use force to solve this
        problem by using the <a href="Hippo_Hip">Hippo Hip</a> supported
        uprising caused by restlessness over taxes to remove the powers of the
        lesser nobles after putting down the uprising. The king deposed and
        tried to execute Hippo Hip after this, which made Zeb's position safer.
        Following this, he paid another bribe to become the duke of
        the Swamps, and there he put in place the same measures he had in the
        Savannah. He continued to inherit other lands, the most notable being a
        duchy in Southern Africa, which then became his home for the rest of his
        life.
